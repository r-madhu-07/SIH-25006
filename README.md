## Problem Title
SIH 25006: Development of a Digital Farm Management Portal for implementing Biosecurity measures in Pig and Poultry Farms
## Problem Description
### Background

Biosecurity is a cornerstone of livestock health management, especially in the pig and poultry sectors where diseases such as Avian Influenza and African Swine Fever pose serious threats. These outbreaks can cause severe economic losses, undermine food security, and disrupt rural livelihoods. Despite its importance, many farmers—particularly smallholders in resource-constrained regions—lack access to practical, easy-to-understand information on biosecurity protocols, risk assessment, and regulatory compliance.

## Problem Description

There is a pressing need for a user-friendly digital platform that helps farmers implement, evaluate, and sustain effective biosecurity practices. The proposed portal will provide end-to-end support for farm-level biosecurity management by integrating:

• Customizable risk assessment tools calibrated to local epidemiological conditions.

• Interactive training modules and best-practice guidelines tailored to pig and poultry production.

• Compliance tracking features aligned with government regulations to support disease-free compartment certification.

• Real-time alerts and dashboards for monitoring disease outbreaks and potential biosecurity breaches.

• A multilingual, mobile-first interface to ensure accessibility for users in remote and rural areas.

The platform will also facilitate data collection for better policymaking, enable collaboration among farmers, veterinarians, and extension workers, and strengthen long-term resilience in the livestock sector.

## Expected Outcomes

• Increased farmer awareness and education on biosecurity.

• Improved farm-level risk management and self-assessment capabilities.

• Easy access to customised biosecurity protocols and guidelines.

• Digital record-keeping and simplified compliance monitoring.

• Timely alerts and notifications about disease risks.

• Healthier livestock and higher farm productivity.

• Empowerment of small and marginal farmers with limited resources.

• Support for authorities through data-driven disease surveillance.

• Enhanced collaboration across the livestock ecosystem.

• Stronger national preparedness for zoonotic and transboundary diseases.

## Problem Creator’s Organization

Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying

## Theme

Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying (DoAH&D)

## Proposed Solution

A Digital Farm Biosecurity Management Portal—a comprehensive platform designed to help pig and poultry farmers adopt and track robust biosecurity practices.

## Key Features
### 1. AI-Driven Biosecurity Risk Assessment

• Custom questionnaires tailored to farm size, geographic location, and species.

• Automated scoring and personalized recommendations.

• Geo-based vulnerability mapping for disease risk.

### 2. Interactive Learning & Capacity Building

• Short, practical video modules, infographics, and quizzes in multiple Indian languages.

• Species-specific best-practice guidelines.

• Certification for farmers who complete training modules.

### 3. Digital Compliance & Record Keeping

• Daily logbooks for mortality, feed intake, visitor entry, waste disposal, etc.

• Auto-generated reports mapped to DoAH&D standards.

• Step-by-step guidance for achieving compartment (disease-free) status.

### 4. Real-Time Alerts & Data Dashboards

• Integration with state veterinary networks for verified disease alerts.

• Optional IoT sensor integration for environment and movement monitoring.

• Customized dashboards for farmers, veterinarians, and administrators.

### 5. Collaboration & Community Support

• Direct chat support with veterinarians for guidance and emergencies.

• Discussion forums, peer networks, and expert webinars.

### 6. Offline-First, Mobile-Friendly Design

• Works efficiently in low-connectivity areas.

• Lightweight interface optimized for rural users and basic smartphones.

## Technical Approach

Technologies to Be Used

Frontend: React.js / Flutter

Backend: Node.js / Django / FastAPI

Database: PostgreSQL + Redis

AI/ML: Python (scikit-learn, TensorFlow Lite)

Maps & Geo-Analytics: Leaflet.js / Mapbox

IoT Integration: MQTT protocol, ESP32 sensors

Deployment: Docker, Kubernetes, Cloud (AWS / Azure / NIC MeghRaj)

## Feasibility and Viability
### Feasibility

• Technical: Built using scalable, widely used technologies.

• Economic: Low deployment cost; eligible for government support.

• Operational: Easily adopted by farmers, vets, and state agencies.

• Environmental: Helps reduce disease outbreaks and improves sustainability.

## Potential Challenges

• Low digital literacy among small farmers.

• Poor rural internet connectivity.

• Reluctance to adopt new systems.

• Data privacy and security concerns.

## Mitigation Strategies

• Multilingual and voice-guided user interface.

• Robust offline functionality.

• On-ground support through extension workers.

• Strong encryption and role-based access controls.

• Gamified incentives to encourage adoption.

## Impact and Benefits
### Target Audience Impact

• Farmers gain better knowledge, productivity, and disease prevention abilities.

• Veterinarians can monitor farms more efficiently and provide timely advice.

• Authorities benefit from real-time, accurate data for policy planning.

## Overall Benefits

Social: Improved animal health, reduced zoonotic risks, empowered farmers.
Economic: Fewer disease-related losses, more stable farm income.
Environmental: Better waste management and more sustainable farming practices.
