## Problem Title
SIH 25006: Development of a Digital Farm Management Portal for implementing Biosecurity measures in Pig and Poultry Farms
## Problem Description
### Background

Biosecurity is a cornerstone of animal health management, particularly in the pig and poultry sectors, where disease outbreaks such as Avian Influenza and African Swine Fever can cause significant economic losses, threaten food security, and disrupt rural livelihoods. Despite its importance, many farmers—especially smallholders in resource-limited areas—struggle to access practical, actionable information on biosecurity protocols, risk assessment tools, and regulatory compliance requirements.

### Problem Description

There is an urgent need for a user-friendly, digital platform that empowers farmers to implement, monitor, and sustain robust biosecurity practices on their farms. This portal should offer end-to-end solutions for farm-level biosecurity management by integrating:

• Customizable risk assessment tools based on local epidemiological conditions.
• Interactive training modules and best practice guidelines tailored for pig and poultry production systems.
• Compliance tracking features aligned with regulatory frameworks to help farmers work toward disease-free compartment recognition.
• Real-time alerts and monitoring dashboards for disease outbreaks and biosecurity breaches.
• Multilingual and mobile-first design to ensure accessibility in remote and rural areas.

The platform should also enable data collection and analysis for policy support, foster collaborative networking among stakeholders (farmers, veterinarians, extension workers, etc.), and promote long-term resilience and sustainability in the livestock sector.

### Expected Outcomes

• Enhanced farmer awareness and education on biosecurity.
• Improved risk management at the farm level as well as self-assessment.
• Easy access to customized biosecurity protocols and guidelines.
• Digital record-keeping and compliance tracking.
• Timely alerts and disease notifications to farmers.
• Healthier livestock and increased farm productivity.
• Empowerment of small and marginal farmers with limited resources.
• Support to authorities in data-driven surveillance and policy making.
• Stronger collaboration across the livestock ecosystem.
• Improved national preparedness for zoonotic and transboundary diseases.

## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying

## Theme
Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying (DoAH&D)

## Proposed Solution
We propose building a Digital Farm Biosecurity Management Portal, a one-stop platform tailored for pig and poultry farmers to easily implement and monitor biosecurity practices.

## Key Features
## 1.AI-Driven Biosecurity Risk Assessment Tool
Custom questionnaires based on farm size, location, species, and management practices.

Automatic scoring of biosecurity risks with actionable recommendations.

Geo-based disease vulnerability mapping.

## 2.Interactive Learning & Capacity Building
Short video-based modules, quizzes, and infographics in multiple Indian languages.

Species-specific best practices (pig/poultry).

Certification system for farmers completing training modules.

## 3.Digital Compliance & Record-Keeping
Daily logbooks for mortality, feed intake, visitor entry, waste management, etc.

Auto-generated reports aligned with DoAH&D regulations.

Stepwise guidance for obtaining compartment status (disease-free recognition).

## 4.Real-Time Alerts & Data Dashboards
Integration with state veterinary departments for disease alerts.

IoT sensor support (optional) for temperature, humidity, and visitor movement.

Profile-based dashboards for farmers, veterinarians, and administrators.

## 5.Collaboration & Community Support
Vet-farmer chat support and emergency assistance.

Discussion forums, knowledge sharing, and expert webinars.

## 6.Offline-First, Mobile-Friendly Design
Works in low-network conditions.

Lightweight interface for rural users.

## Technical Approach

Technologies to Be Used

Frontend: React.js / Flutter (for mobile app).

Backend: Node.js / Django / FastAPI.

Database: PostgreSQL + Redis (for caching).

AI/ML: Python (scikit-learn, TensorFlow Lite for mobile).

Mapping & Geo-Analytics: Leaflet.js / Mapbox.

IoT Integration (optional): MQTT protocol, ESP32 sensors.

Deployment: Docker, Kubernetes, Cloud (AWS / Azure / NIC Cloud MeghRaj).

## Feasibility and Viability
## Feasibility Analysis
Technical: Uses widely adopted, scalable technologies.

Economic: Can be deployed at low cost; supported by government schemes.

Operational: Direct adoption by farmers, veterinarians, and state departments.

Environmental: Reduces disease outbreaks and improves sustainability.

## Potential Challenges & Risks
Low digital literacy among small farmers.

Poor internet connectivity in rural areas.

Resistance to adapting new tools.

Data privacy and security concerns.

## Strategies to Overcome Challenges
Multilingual voice-guided UI.

Offline-mode capability.

On-ground training through extension workers.

Strict data encryption & role-based access control.

Gamified incentives to promote adoption.

## Impact and Benefits
## Potential Impact on Target Audience
Farmers gain improved awareness, productivity, and disease prevention skills.

Veterinarians can monitor farms and provide guidance more effectively.

Authorities benefit from real-time data for better policy decisions.

## Overall Benefits
## Social:

Better animal health and reduced zoonotic disease risk.

Improved farmer knowledge and empowerment.

## Economic:
Reduction in losses from disease outbreaks.

Increased productivity and income stability.

## Environmental:
Improved waste management.

Sustainable and responsible farming practices.
